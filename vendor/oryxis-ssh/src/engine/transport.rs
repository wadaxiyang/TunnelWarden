//! The SSH CONNECTION, as distinct from a session on it (F2).
//!
//! One TCP socket, one key exchange, one authentication. Channels are
//! cheap on top of it: a PTY, an SFTP subsystem and every port-forward
//! listener are all channels on the same connection, which is why a
//! second tab to a host that is already open should not pay for another
//! handshake.
//!
//! Splitting it out of `SshSession` is what makes that possible, and it
//! fixes something on the way: the RTT prober used to be per SESSION,
//! so two sessions to one host meant two pings measuring the same wire.
//! Now there is exactly one prober per connection, because the prober
//! belongs to the thing it measures.
//!
//! Lifetime is `Arc`, deliberately. Sessions, the SFTP surface and the
//! app's reuse pool all hold (or weakly hold) the same transport, and
//! the connection closes when the last owner lets go. Hand-rolled
//! reference counting is the alternative, and it is the kind that
//! leaks a live socket the first time a path forgets to decrement.
